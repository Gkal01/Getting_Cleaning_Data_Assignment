The run_analysis.R scripts is used to perform the following actions:

1) It downloads the dataset and unzips it under the folder called "UCI HAR Dataset"

2) It assigns each set of data to variables:
      features <- features.txt
      The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
      
	  activities <- activity_labels.txt
      List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes 
      
	  subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
      contains test data of test subjects (9/20 subjects) being observed
      
	  x_test <- test/X_test.txt 
      contains recorded features test data
      
	  y_test <- test/y_test.txt 
      contains test data of activities’code labels
      
	  subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
      contains train data of 21/30 subjects being observed
      
	  x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
      contains recorded features train data
      
	  y_train <- test/y_train.txt
      contains train data of activities’code labels
		
3) It merges the training and the test datasets to create one new data set by using the rbind() and cbind() functions. With the rbind() functions
it merges the x_test and x_train into the x_merged, the y_test and the y_train to the y_merged and the subject_test and subject_train to the subject_merged.
Finally, the cbind() function is used to merge the columns of the subject_merged,x_merged and y_merged.

4) It creates a tidy data set (tidy_df) by extracting only the measurements on the mean and the std from the Full_merged data frame and it applies appropriate
names on each variable extracted from the second column of the activities data frame.

5) It renames each column of the tidy data set tidy_df by providing descriptive variable names by expanding names such as Acc. to Accelerometer, etc.

6) It creates the new_df data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This is achieved by grouping the tidy_df with respect to the activities and the subjects and then taking the average for each variable.

7) Finally, it writes the new_df data set into a .txt file called "FinalDF.txt".
